# Mira

A local AI assistant with autonomous web search, file attachments (PDF/HTML/images/text), and RAG for large documents. Available as a CLI tool and a local web interface with streaming markdown responses.

Supports two local inference backends:

| Backend | Model | Context | Host |
|---------|-------|---------|------|
| **Ollama** (default) | gemma4:26b | 64k tokens | `http://localhost:11434` |
| **oMLX** | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | 262k tokens | `http://localhost:8080` |

## Features

- **Autonomous Search**: Model searches the web and fetches full page content when snippets aren't enough — sources are shown as clickable links
- **Streaming responses**: Tokens buffered and rendered as formatted markdown
- **Two interfaces**: Rich CLI and local web UI (FastAPI + SSE)
- **File attachments**: PDFs (RAG), HTML, images (multimodal), text/code files — tested with books up to 34 MB
- **RAG**: Large documents chunked, embedded, reranked with CrossEncoder — retrieved automatically on every turn, with hallucination guard for meta-queries (summarize, translate)
- **Private**: Runs entirely on your local machine — no cloud APIs, no telemetry

## Prerequisites

### Ollama (default)

- **Python 3.12+** and **uv**
- **Ollama** v0.24.0+ installed and running
- **gemma4:26b**: `ollama pull gemma4:26b`
- **nomic-embed-text** (RAG embeddings): `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`

### oMLX (alternative)

- **Python 3.12+** and **uv**
- **oMLX** installed at `/Applications/oMLX.app`
- API key in `~/.omlx/settings.json` under `auth.api_key`

Set `backend: omlx` in `mira.yaml` to use oMLX (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

Mira starts the configured backend automatically on launch — no manual server command needed.

## Setup

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

> On first use, the CrossEncoder reranker model (~100 MB) downloads automatically from HuggingFace and caches to `~/.cache/huggingface/`.

## Running

**CLI:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Web interface** — open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser:
```bash
python server.py
```

For remote access (iPad via Tailscale), the server also listens on HTTPS port **8443** — configure `SSL_CERTFILE` / `SSL_KEYFILE` in the plist (see [macOS LaunchAgent](#macos-launchagent-optional)) and connect to `https://<mac-hostname>:8443`.

Mira starts the configured inference backend automatically. If oMLX or Ollama is already running, it reuses the existing process.

### Ollama env vars

Add to `~/.zprofile` for optimal performance on Apple Silicon:

| Variable | Value | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` | `65536` | 64k token context window; must match `context_window` in `mira.yaml` |
| `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION` | `1` | Reduces KV cache memory ~40% |
| `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` | `1` | Prevents doubling the KV cache (single-user app) |
| `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE` | `q8_0` | Halves KV cache memory vs f16 default |

Metal/GPU acceleration is on by default on macOS — no extra flag needed. See `docs/model-comparison-m5-macbook.md` for benchmarks and model alternatives.

## macOS LaunchAgent (optional)

To run the web server as a background service that starts at login:

```bash
cp com.mab.mira.plist.template com.mab.mira.plist
cp start-mira-server.sh.template start-mira-server.sh
```

Edit both files — replace `<MIRA_DIR>` and `<YOUR_HOME>` with your actual paths. If you are not using HTTPS/Tailscale, remove the `SSL_CERTFILE` / `SSL_KEYFILE` keys from the plist.

```bash
chmod +x start-mira-server.sh
cp com.mab.mira.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mab.mira.plist
```

Both filled-in files are git-ignored (they contain local paths). Only the `*.template` originals are committed.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/toggle` | Toggle verbose mode (show/hide search details) |
| `/verbose` | Enable verbose mode |
| `/quiet` | Disable verbose mode |
| `/reset` | Reset conversation history and RAG index |
| `/attach <path>` | Stage a file for the next message (PDF, HTML, image, text) |
| `/files` | List currently staged attachments |
| `/detach` | Clear all staged attachments |
| `/rag-list` | List documents currently in the RAG index |
| `/rag-remove <name>` | Remove a document from the RAG index |
| `/quit` | Exit |

## Web Interface

- Streaming responses with live markdown rendering
- 📎 upload button — attach files from your machine
- 📂 folder browser — navigate the server's filesystem, filter by extension, select multiple files; files with wrong or missing extension are shown greyed out with a rejection warning
- Search chips expand to show clickable source links; fetch chips link directly to the fetched page
- Green Documents panel showing RAG-indexed files with per-doc remove
- Status bar showing current operation (Thinking / Searching / Reading / Indexing)
- **Status line** — header badges `↑Xk ↓Xk` (session tokens) and `ctx:N%` (context window fill, color-coded: grey → red → dark as it fills)
- **Stop button** — aborts the current response mid-stream; history rolls back as if the turn never happened
- Verbose toggle and conversation reset in the header
- Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline

## File Attachments

| File type | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| PDF (any size) | Always indexed via RAG |
| HTML | Text extracted (BeautifulSoup); RAG if > 80k chars |
| Text / code | Injected directly; RAG if > 80k chars |
| Images | Passed via multimodal API (base64) |
| Scanned PDF | Warning emitted; no text extractable |

RAG documents persist in the session index across turns — no need to re-attach for follow-up questions. Use `/rag-remove` or Reset to clear.

## Configuration

Copy `mira.yaml.example` to `mira.yaml` and edit. All fields are optional — omit any to keep the built-in default.

```yaml
backend: ollama            # ollama | omlx
model: gemma4:26b
host: http://localhost:11434

embed_backend: ollama
embed_model: nomic-embed-text
embed_host: http://localhost:11434

context_window: 65536
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `backend` | `ollama` | Inference backend: `ollama` or `omlx` |
| `model` | `gemma4:26b` | Model name as shown in the backend (`Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` for oMLX) |
| `host` | `http://localhost:11434` | Backend host URL (`http://localhost:8080` for oMLX) |
| `embed_backend` | same as `backend` | Embedding backend for RAG |

| `embed_host` | same as `host` | Embedding host URL |
| `context_window` | `65536` | Token context window (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B: `262144`) |

Additional settings (not user-configurable via `mira.yaml` — edit `core/config.py` only if needed):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS` | `5` | Results per web search |
| `MAX_TOOL_STEPS` | `10` | Max tool calls per turn |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | API error retries per call |
| `SEARCH_TIMEOUT` | `30` | DuckDuckGo timeout in seconds |
| `RERANK_MODEL` | `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` | CrossEncoder reranker |
| `RAG_CHUNK_SIZE` | `400` | Words per RAG chunk |
| `RAG_CHUNK_OVERLAP` | `40` | Word overlap between chunks |
| `RAG_RETRIEVE_K` | `10` | Candidates retrieved before reranking |
| `RAG_RERANK_TOP_K` | `4` | Chunks injected after reranking |
| `RAG_SCORE_THRESHOLD` | `0.0` | Minimum CrossEncoder score to inject |
| `RAG_MAX_CHUNKS` | `10000` | Warn when index exceeds this size |

## Testing

All model, search, and fetch calls are mocked — no inference server needed to run tests.

```bash
uv run pytest                                              # all tests
uv run pytest tests/test_queries.py::test_toggle_verbose  # single test
uv run pytest tests/test_cancel.py                        # cancel/stop tests only
```

Tests cover: search trigger behaviour, `fetch_url` dispatch, intermediate-chunk tool calls (`accumulated_tool_calls`), RAG threshold bypass for same-turn attachments, verbose toggle, conversation reset, stop/cancel endpoint, event stream abort, history rollback on cancel, stats event emission, token count capture, context % bounds.
