# Web UI Test Plan

**URL:** `http://localhost:8000`  
**Start server:** `python server.py`  
**Prerequisites:** Ollama running locally with `gemma4:26b` pulled

Test cases are grouped by feature area. Each case lists the action, expected result, and pass/fail column. Run top-to-bottom in a fresh browser tab (no prior session state) unless the case says otherwise.

---

## 1. Page load and initial state

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1.1 | Open `http://localhost:8000` | Page loads; header shows "ollama Search Tool" and model badge `gemma4:26b` |
| 1.2 | Inspect header controls | Verbose checkbox unchecked; Reset button visible |
| 1.3 | Inspect footer | Paperclip (📎) button and textarea visible; no file chips |
| 1.4 | Inspect chat area | Welcome screen with search icon and "Ask anything" message |

---

## 2. Basic chat — no search, no files

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 2.1 | Type "What is 2 + 2?" and press Enter | Thinking indicator (three dots) appears; then response streams in; answer contains "4" |
| 2.2 | Observe answer rendering | Response rendered as markdown (not raw text) |
| 2.3 | Send a second message in the same session | Previous messages remain visible; conversation context is maintained |
| 2.4 | Press Shift+Enter in the textarea | Newline inserted; message not sent |
| 2.5 | Click Send with empty textarea | Nothing happens; no request sent |

---

## 3. Web search

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 3.1 | Ask "Who won the most recent Champions League?" | Thinking → search chip with spinner and query text → "Found N results" chip → thinking → answer |
| 3.2 | Observe search chip final state | Chip shows ✅ and result count |
| 3.3 | Ask a question with no recent information ("What is the capital of France?") | Answer arrives without any search chip |
| 3.4 | Enable Verbose checkbox; ask a current-events question | Behaviour unchanged (verbose only affects CLI; web always shows search chips regardless) |

---

## 4. Streaming and UI state during response

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 4.1 | While a response is streaming, observe Send button | Send button hidden; red Stop button visible in its place |
| 4.2 | While streaming, observe textarea | Disabled; cannot type |
| 4.3 | While streaming, observe paperclip button | Disabled |
| 4.4 | After response completes | Stop button hidden; Send button and textarea re-enabled |

---

## 5. Reset

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 5.1 | Send two messages; click Reset | Chat area clears; welcome screen returns |
| 5.2 | Send a follow-up message that references the earlier conversation | Model has no memory of the cleared messages |
| 5.3 | Click Reset while streaming | Button does nothing (disabled by isStreaming guard) — verify no crash |

---

## 6. File attachments — images

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 6.1 | Click 📎; select a PNG or JPG image | File chip with filename appears above textarea |
| 6.2 | Click the ✕ on the chip | Chip removed; no files staged |
| 6.3 | Attach an image; type "Describe this image" and send | Image chip shown in user bubble; model response describes the image content |
| 6.4 | Send the next message (no attachment) | No file chip in user bubble; model answers from conversation context only |

---

## 7. File attachments — text and code

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 7.1 | Attach a `.txt` or `.py` file; ask "Summarise this file" | Model response summarises the file content |
| 7.2 | Attach a `.json` file; ask "What keys are in the root object?" | Model correctly reads the JSON structure |
| 7.3 | Attach multiple files (e.g. two `.txt` files) | Both chips shown in footer and in user bubble; model can reference both |

---

## 8. File attachments — PDF

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 8.1 | Attach a small text-based PDF (< 80k chars); ask a question about its content | Model answers from the document; no warning chip |
| 8.2 | Attach a large text-based PDF (> 80k chars) | Amber ⚠️ warning chip: "truncated to 80,000 characters … consider RAG" |
| 8.3 | Attach a scanned (image-only) PDF | Amber ⚠️ warning chip: "scanned PDF with no extractable text" |

---

## 9. File attachments — HTML

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 9.1 | Attach an `.html` file; ask "What is the main topic of this page?" | Model answers from the readable text; no raw HTML tags in the injected content |

---

## 10. Error states

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 10.1 | Stop Ollama; send a message | Red ❌ error chip with a descriptive message |
| 10.2 | Restart Ollama; send a message | Normal response; no residual error state |

---

## 11. RAG (large document retrieval)

> **Test documents needed:**
> - `small.pdf` — a text-based PDF under 80k chars (e.g. a 5-page article)
> - `large.pdf` — a text-based PDF over 80k chars with specific facts in the latter half
> - `second.pdf` — a second document on a different topic
> - `scanned.pdf` — an image-only PDF with no text layer
>
> **Accuracy ground truth:** before running these tests, read `large.pdf` and write down 3 specific facts that appear only after the first ~80k characters. These are your retrieval accuracy probes.

### 11a. Indexing and UI feedback

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 11.1 | Attach any PDF (small or large) | Indexing chip appears: "Indexing [filename]…" with spinner |
| 11.2 | Wait for indexing to complete | Chip updates: "Indexed N chunks — [filename]" |
| 11.3 | Attach a second PDF while the first is indexed | Second doc indexed and added; first doc remains in index |
| 11.4 | Observe the Documents panel in the web UI | Both filenames listed with ✕ remove buttons |
| 11.5 | Click ✕ on one document | That document removed from index; remaining document still listed |
| 11.6 | Click Reset | Documents panel disappears; RAG index cleared along with conversation history |

### 11b. Retrieval accuracy

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 11.7 | Attach `large.pdf`; ask about a fact from the **first** quarter of the document | Correct answer; model cites the right section |
| 11.8 | Ask about a fact from the **latter half** of the document (past 80k chars) | Correct answer — proves RAG retrieves beyond the old truncation point |
| 11.9 | Ask one of your 3 ground-truth probe questions | Answer matches the known fact exactly |
| 11.10 | Ask a second probe question without re-attaching | Correct answer — RAG index persists across turns |
| 11.11 | Ask a question whose answer is not in the document | Model says it cannot find that information in the document (does not hallucinate from the document) |
| 11.12 | Ask a question entirely unrelated to any indexed document | Model answers from general knowledge; no RAG chunks injected (reranker score below threshold) |

### 11c. Reranking quality

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 11.13 | Ask a vague question with several plausible sections in the document | Answer uses the most relevant section, not just the first retrieved chunk |
| 11.14 | Ask the same question with reranking disabled (set `RERANK_TOP_K = 0` temporarily) | Note any difference in answer quality — confirms reranker is adding value |

### 11d. Multi-document retrieval

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 11.15 | Index `large.pdf` and `second.pdf` (different topics); ask about topic from `large.pdf` | Correct answer; chunks from `second.pdf` not injected |
| 11.16 | Ask about topic from `second.pdf` | Correct answer from `second.pdf` |
| 11.17 | Ask a question that spans both documents | Answer draws from both; no hallucination |

### 11e. Edge cases

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 11.18 | Attach `scanned.pdf` | Warning chip: scanned PDF, no text extracted; no indexing attempted |
| 11.19 | Attach `small.pdf` (under 80k chars) | Still goes through RAG (PDFs always use RAG); indexing chip shown |
| 11.20 | Index enough documents to exceed the chunk threshold | Warning chip recommending the user unload documents |

---

## 12. Clickable sources and fetch chips

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 12.1 | Ask a current-events question that triggers a search | After search completes, a sources list appears below the search chip with bulleted links |
| 12.2 | Observe sources list default state | List is expanded (open) by default; ▴ indicator on the chip |
| 12.3 | Click the search chip | Sources list collapses; indicator changes to ▾ |
| 12.4 | Click the chip again | Sources list re-expands; indicator returns to ▴ |
| 12.5 | Click a link in the sources list | Opens the source URL in a new browser tab |
| 12.6 | Ask a question where the model fetches a page (`fetch_url`) | A "Reading: hostname" chip with spinner appears, then updates to "✅ Read N.Nk chars — hostname" with a clickable link |
| 12.7 | Click the hostname link in the fetch chip | Opens the fetched URL in a new tab |
| 12.8 | Ask a question requiring multiple searches or fetches | Each search and fetch produces its own chip; all remain visible after the response |

---

## 13. Stop button

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 13.1 | Send any message; observe footer while streaming | Send button hidden; red Stop button visible in its place |
| 13.2 | After response completes | Stop button hidden; Send button returns |
| 13.3 | Send a message; click Stop during the thinking phase | Response aborts; thinking indicator removed; Stop disappears and Send returns |
| 13.4 | Send a message; click Stop while tokens are streaming | Streaming halts mid-sentence; partial text remains visible; Send re-enabled |
| 13.5 | Send a message; click Stop while a search chip is spinning | Search halts; chip may remain; Send re-enabled |
| 13.6 | After stopping, send a new message | Conversation continues normally; model has no memory of the cancelled turn |
| 13.7 | After stopping, send a follow-up that references the cancelled turn | Model has no context from the aborted turn (history was rolled back) |
